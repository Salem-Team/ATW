1 - Analyzed the task requirements carefully to ensure I understood all expectations.

2 - Divided the project into multiple components to maintain a clean code structure and reusability.

3 - Used Vue 3 as the main framework and Tailwind CSS for styling.

4 - Completed the full design implementation, then made sure it was fully responsive across all screen sizes.

5 - Integrated the API:

Finished the login functionality using the /login endpoint and stored the user token in localStorage.

Fetched the dynamic data for the "Collections" section using the /tasks endpoint with authorization headers.

6 - Tested the project thoroughly, both in terms of functionality and design, and finally pushed the code to GitHub.
